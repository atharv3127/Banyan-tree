The Banyan tree, scientifically known as Ficus benghalensis, is a large, long-lived, and fast-growing evergreen tree that belongs to the fig family. It's characterized by its wide, leafy crown and extensive aerial roots, which can spread over a large area, sometimes even covering several acres. These aerial roots, also known as prop roots, descend from the branches and grow into thick, woody trunks, creating a dense thicket-like appearance.
